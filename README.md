# Exercises from "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie

Chronicling my trip through the classic K&amp;R "C Programming Language."

While the book may be relatively brief relative to other programming tomes, the exercises are *numerous* and many of them are quite challening.

Generally, filenames will reflect the exercises they're meant to solve.

# Don't Judge Me, Please!

The goal here was to re-learn C in anticipation of a pet project I'm planning on tackling.

None of this code is meant to be bulletproof, nor a masterpiece of coding style, nor were all edge cases considered.

Getting through all the examples in K&R is tough enough without trying to craft flawless gems....
